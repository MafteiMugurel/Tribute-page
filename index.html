                <p id="img-caption"> Our beloved Tim was a seeker, a fragile artistic soul searching for
                    answers to existential questions. An over-achieving perfectionist who
                    travelled and worked hard at a pace that led to extreme stress. When he
                    stopped touring, he wanted to find a balance in life to be able to be
                    happy and to do what he loved most – music. He really struggled with
                    thoughts about Meaning, Life, Happiness. He could now not go on any
                    longer. He wanted to find peace. Tim was not made for the business machine
                    he found himself in; he was a sensitive guy who loved his fans but shunned
                    the spotlight. Tim, you will forever be loved and sadly missed. The person
                    you were and your music will keep your memory alive. We love you, The
                    Family</p>
